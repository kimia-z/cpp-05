/*
- A constant name.
- A boolean indicating whether it is signed (at construction, it is not).
- A constant grade required to sign it.
- A constant grade required to execute it.

The grades of the Form follow the same rules as those of the Bureaucrat. Thus, the
following exceptions will be thrown if a form’s grade is out of bounds:
Form::GradeTooHighException and Form::GradeTooLowException.

Also, add a beSigned() member function to the Form that takes a Bureaucrat as a
parameter. It changes the form’s status to signed if the bureaucrat’s grade is high enough
(greater than or equal to the required one). Remember, grade 1 is higher than grade 2.
If the grade is too low, throw a Form::GradeTooLowException.
Then, modify the signForm() member function in the Bureaucrat class. This function must call Form::beSigned() to attempt to sign the form. If the form is signed
successfully, it will print something like:
<bureaucrat> signed <form>
Otherwise, it will print something like:
<bureaucrat> couldn’t sign <form> because <reason>.
